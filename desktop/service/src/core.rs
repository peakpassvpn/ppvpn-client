//! The privileged TUN instance: the Rust ppvpn-core engine
//! (`Role::Tun`, docs/host-integration.md) in this process, and the
//! client's Core API calls on it.
//!
//! One instance at a time, owned by one client session: the session that
//! connected, under the OS user that connected it, for as long as its lease
//! is renewed. Two rules keep an old instance from hurting its successor:
//!
//! - **Keyed to the instance.** A Core API call is bound to the instance it
//!   was authorized for (it holds that instance, not the slot), so a call
//!   meant for an older instance never reaches a newer one.
//! - **Stopped means shut down.** [`CoreManager::stop_because`] returns only
//!   once the engine's `shutdown` did (bounded, 10 s): its TUN, routes and
//!   rules are gone before the next instance starts.
//!
//! An instance that reaches `Fatal` is stopped like one whose lease lapsed
//! (the watchdog's [`CoreManager::reap_exited`]); its session's watchers
//! hear `exited`, and the client connects again. On Windows a shutdown that
//! leaves WFP filters (or anything it cannot classify) behind ends the
//! process: the filters belong to the process, and the service manager
//! restarts the service.
