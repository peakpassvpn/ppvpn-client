# Packages the Flutter app (#401 step 5) as the native macOS release did
# (#522 removed it): the same PPVPN.app layout, signing, DMG, .pkg and
# release-meta.
#
# Usage: apps/flutter/scripts/package-macos.sh <PPVPN.app> arm64|x86_64
#   <PPVPN.app> is what scripts/ci-build.sh built; it is copied, not changed.
#   SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1           reuse the PPVPNClient package and the generated
#                              apps/macos project (apps/macos/scripts/bootstrap.sh)
#   PPVPN_BINARIES_DIR         the service helpers, <bin>-universal-apple-darwin or
#                              <bin>-<triple> (default build/binaries, as
#                              tools/desktop/build-service.sh stages them)
#   PPVPN_UPDATE_FEED_URL      Sparkle appcast. Unset: the channel's feed on the update
#                              site, <PPVPN_UPDATE_SITE>/desktop/<channel>/appcast-<platform>.xml,
#                              when both the site and the channel are given; otherwise
#                              updates are off
#   PPVPN_SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY   Sparkle EdDSA public key
#   and package-app.sh's: PPVPN_CODESIGN_IDENTITY, PPVPN_CODESIGN_TEAM,
#   PPVPN_INSTALLER_IDENTITY, PPVPN_NOTARY_*, PPVPN_RELEASE_CHANNEL,
#   SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE.
#
# Into the copy, at the native app's paths:
#   Contents/Library/LoginItems/PPVPN Agent.app   the Swift push agent, built
#       from apps/macos (target PPVPNAgent); the app registers it
#       (runner/macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift, PushAgentService)
#   Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/com.peakpassvpn.ppvpn.desktop.agent.plist
#   Contents/Frameworks/PPVPNClientFFI.framework  the agent's client
#   Contents/MacOS/ppvpn-service{,-install,-uninstall}  what rust/src/hooks.rs
#       runs for enhanced mode
#   Contents/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework  Sparkle as the agent's build resolved
#       it (apps/macos/project.yml), which the runner loads (MainFlutterWindow.swift,
#       Updater), and the Info.plist keys it reads: PPVPNUpdateFeedURL,
#       SUPublicEDKey, SUEnableAutomaticChecks
# then apps/macos/scripts/package-app.sh: thinning, inside-out signing with
# packaging/macos/PPVPN.entitlements, and dist/macos/PPVPN-<version>-<platform>.dmg,
# .pkg and release-meta-<platform>.json.
