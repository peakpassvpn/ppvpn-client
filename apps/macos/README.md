# PPVPN for macOS: push agent and packaging

The macOS app is the Flutter one (`apps/flutter`, #401); the native SwiftUI app
is gone (#522). What stays here:

- `PPVPNAgent`, the Swift push agent: a UI-less helper that launchd keeps
  running at login (`LaunchAgents/`, registered by the app through
  `SMAppService.agent`). It long-polls the backend through the client crate's
  `PushAgent` (`crates/desktop`, UniFFI) and shows each push as a
  notification; a click opens `ppvpn://push/<id>` in the app.
- `AppLogic`, the SwiftPM package `PPVPNAppLogic` the agent uses beyond the
  bindings: its log and the app's directories. No AppKit, so it builds and
  tests on Linux too.
- `project.yml` (XcodeGen), whose `PPVPNAgent` target also resolves Sparkle,
  which the Flutter app's package takes from that build.
- `scripts/package-app.sh` and `packaging/postinstall`: thinning, signing,
  the DMG, the .pkg and the release metadata, run by
  `apps/flutter/scripts/package-macos.sh`.

Paths and commands here are relative to the repository root.

## Build and test

```bash
# PPVPNClient Swift package + PPVPN.xcodeproj
apps/macos/scripts/bootstrap.sh            # --release for an optimised crate
xcodebuild -project apps/macos/PPVPN.xcodeproj -scheme PPVPNAgent -configuration Debug build

# AppLogic's tests: macOS, after bootstrap.sh
swift test --package-path apps/macos/AppLogic
# Linux (CI pins Swift 6.4.0): builds the crate and a Linux PPVPNClient package
apps/macos/scripts/build-swift-linux.sh
swift test --package-path apps/macos/AppLogic
```

`PPVPN.xcodeproj` and `PPVPNClient/` are generated and git-ignored; re-run
`bootstrap.sh` after `project.yml` or the ppvpn-client interface changes.

## Release DMG and package

`apps/flutter/scripts/package-macos.sh` puts the agent, the shared
`PPVPNClientFFI.framework`, Sparkle and the service helpers into the Flutter
app, then `package-app.sh` thins every Mach-O to the one architecture and
re-signs inside out, checks each binary's architecture, that the agent links
the single framework in `Contents/Frameworks`, and the signature. It writes
the DMG, the package and `release-meta-macos-<arm64|x64>.json` (schema 1:
platform, channel, version, build, file, length, sha256, ed_signature, min_os,
published_at, all of the DMG, plus install_file, install_length and
install_sha256 of the package), from which the update site's feed is written.
The package (`pkgbuild`) installs only to /Applications, is not relocatable,
and runs `packaging/postinstall`, which hands the bundle to the console user
so that Sparkle updates it without an administrator prompt
(docs/security.md). `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` fills `ed_signature`. CI
(`tools/desktop/ci/build-macos-native.sh`) builds both architectures on an
Apple silicon runner into one artifact.

## Signing and installing

Releases are signed with our Apple Developer ID (Team ID in
`crates/service/src/macos_team_id`, #471) and notarized. CI
(`tools/desktop/ci/build-macos-native.sh`) imports the Developer ID
Application and Installer identities into a temporary keychain from the
`MACOS_SIGNING_P12_*` and `MACOS_INSTALLER_P12_*` secrets, refuses
identities of any other kind or team, and passes the App Store Connect API
key (`ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_P8`) to notarytool.
`package-app.sh` then:

- signs every piece of code inside out with the hardened runtime and a
  secure timestamp, keeping codesign's own designated requirements
  (identifier, Apple's anchor, the Team ID), which carry across builds and
  certificate renewals (keychain access, the push agent's SMAppService
  registration, the notification permission);
- takes `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` out of the
  entitlements: every embedded library carries the same Team ID;
- notarizes the app and staples its ticket, builds the DMG (signed) and the
  pkg (`productsign`, Developer ID Installer) from it, notarizes and staples
  both, and checks Gatekeeper's verdict on all three;
- only then signs the DMG for Sparkle and writes the release metadata.

A stable build without the identities or the API key fails. Without them
(local builds, pull requests) signing falls back to ad-hoc; CI's packaging
check signs with a throwaway self-signed identity, where each designated
requirement pins that certificate and the entitlements keep
disable-library-validation (no Team ID).

The privileged service accepts only a client with our Developer ID signature
(`crates/service/src/macsign.rs`). A service installed by a release before
the Developer ID (0.7.x and older pin the old self-signed certificate)
refuses the new app, which then reinstalls it once, behind the usual
administrator prompt.

Installing: open the downloaded .pkg; Installer puts the app in
/Applications. The installed app has no quarantine attribute, opens without
asking and is not translocated. From the DMG instead, drag the app to
Applications in Finder. Updates installed by Sparkle keep the same
signature.

## Logs

- App and push agent: `~/Library/Logs/PPVPN/`
- Privileged service and Enhanced Mode engine: `/Library/Logs/PPVPN/` (`ppvpn-service.log`,
  `ppvpn-core.log`, launchd's `ppvpn-service.out.log` / `.err.log`; readable without root;
  5 MB per file, 3 files kept). Uninstalling or reinstalling the service leaves them in place;
  builds up to 18 wrote them inside the helper bundle, where the uninstall deleted them.
