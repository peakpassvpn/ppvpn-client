# Third-party notices (desktop)

Third-party components the desktop apps ship or link, beyond what the engine
links. For the engine see the root
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md): the Rust core, which the
client and the privileged service link, links sail and, through btls,
BoringSSL, at the commits pinned in the root `Cargo.toml`.

The desktop code itself is GPL-3.0-or-later, like the rest of the repository
([LICENSE](../../LICENSE)). Versions below are the ones the tree pins; where the
tree pins none, none is given.

`ppvpn-client` and `ppvpn-service` link further crates from crates.io (tokio,
reqwest with rustls, serde, tracing, log4rs, sysinfo and others). Their exact
versions are in the root `Cargo.lock`; each crate's licence is stated in its own manifest — see upstream.

PPVPN is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the projects above.
