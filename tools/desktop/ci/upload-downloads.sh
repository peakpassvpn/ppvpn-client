# Uploads a release's desktop installers to the private R2 bucket the backend serves downloads
# from, through R2's S3 API (the AWS CLI). The website's download buttons and the update feed
# of the applications before 0.6.0 go to the backend, which reads this bucket on every request:
#
#   clients/desktop/native/releases/<version>/<build>/<installer>                 immutable
#   clients/desktop/native/releases/<version>/<build>/release-meta-<platform>.json  immutable
#   clients/desktop/native/channels/<channel>/release-meta-<platform>.json        the pointer
#
# A pointer is the platform's release-meta with a "path", the installer's key. The backend
# checks it (schema 1, platform, channel, version, build, file, length, sha256, min_os,
# published_at, the path's form, and ed_signature for macOS and Windows), signs a short-lived
# URL of the path for /api/v1/desktop/native/releases/<platform>/download and renders the
# Sparkle feed /api/v1/desktop/releases/<platform>/appcast.xml from it. Nothing is registered
# with the backend: moving the pointers is the release.
#
#   upload-downloads.sh <release dir>           upload
#   upload-downloads.sh --plan <release dir>    verify the files and print the keys; no bucket
#   upload-downloads.sh --check <release dir>   with the bucket's keys, read only: the plan,
#                                               what is already there and what each pointer
#                                               names now; writes nothing (the rehearsal)
#
# <release dir> is the release's files in one directory (release.yml's artifact
# release-files): the five installers and their release-meta-<platform>.json. Every installer
# is checked against its release-meta before the bucket is touched. A release object is never
# replaced: one already there with other content is refused before anything is uploaded, one
# with the same content is kept (a run that failed half way can be run again). The pointers
# move last, after every upload succeeded.
#
# Environment:
#   VERSION, BUILD, CHANNEL   x.y.z, the build number (digits), stable
#   R2_ACCOUNT_ID             the Cloudflare account: https://<id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
#   R2_BUCKET                 the bucket (upload and --check)
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   an R2 API token with object read and write
