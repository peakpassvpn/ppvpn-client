# The site is uploaded over what the bucket holds, while clients read it, so in an order in
# which every file a client can fetch names only files that are already there:
#
#   1  immutable: linux/apt/pool/…, the apt indexes' by-hash copies, linux/rpm/…/repodata/
#      except repomd.xml(.asc) (createrepo_c names them by their checksum), the versioned
#      setup packages linux/setup/*.{deb,rpm}
#   2  the key, the setup packages' signatures (made anew on every build: gpg signatures
#      carry their time) and their stable aliases: linux/ppvpn.asc, linux/setup/*.asc,
#      linux/ppvpn-archive-keyring.deb, linux/ppvpn-release.rpm (+ .asc)
#   3  the apt package indexes: dists/<suite>/main/binary-amd64/Packages{,.gz,.xz}
#   4  the signed indexes: dists/<suite>/{Release,Release.gpg,InRelease}, repomd.xml(.asc)
#   5  the update checks: linux/<channel>/latest.json, desktop/<channel>/appcast-*.xml
#   6  the channel pointers, desktop/channels/*.json, which the release workflow reads back
#
# Anything else is uploaded with tier 5. Nothing is deleted: an index a client fetched before
# this upload names files that stay where they are (old packages, old by-hash indexes).
#
# An immutable file is never replaced: one already in the bucket with other content (its
# x-amz-meta-sha256, which this script sets, or else its content) is refused, before
# anything is uploaded; one with the same content is left as it is. Cache-Control is
# "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" for tier 1 and "no-cache" for the rest.
#
# Environment (upload and --check):
#   R2_ACCOUNT_ID          the Cloudflare account: https://<id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
#   R2_BUCKET              the bucket
